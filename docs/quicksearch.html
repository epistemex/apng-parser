Does not animate the frames but provide them for the program so it can animate or analyze the file. The package comes with a handy animation helper object that can handle the animation, render out a single frame correctly, provide events for each frame etc. Features Parses Animated PNG (APNG) files and builds individual PNG files from each raw frame. Provide frames as raw frames (regions, offsets preserved). Provide frames as rendered (via the helper) Helper can render individual frames to canvas Helper can play forward as well as non-standard backward and ping-pong Helper can generate full-frame sprite-sheets for efficient animations and debugging Non-blocking and asynchronous Fast and easy to use. Usagevar apng = new APNG.Parser(url|blob|file|buffer, callback [,onerror]); var rawFrame = apng.frames[n]; // raw frame n (region, no dipose/blend) var info = apng.frameInfo[n]; // get information about frame nProduces an object holding each individual frame as image as well as individual frame and animation information. You can animate it manually, or use the included APNG.Helper object (which can also be used to render out single frames based on dispose and blend operations): var anim = new APNG.Helper(canvas, apng, options); anim.play(); // play, stop, pause anim.currentFrame = n; // renders full frame n anim.onframe = function(e) { // various callbacks available // render overlay via e.context };See included HTML documentation for details.

Helper new Helper(canvas, apng [, options]) Helper object to animate parsed APNG files (APNGParser objects). The animation is &quot;intelligent&quot; so if a delay is close to 60 FPS (16-17ms) it will use the optimized requestAnimationFrame(). The loop can also be overridden via option to force use of this method for all frames. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description canvas HTMLCanvasElement canvas to use. The correct size will be set internally. apng APNG.Parser APNGParser object to animate options * &lt;optional&gt; options for animation Properties Name Type Argument Default Description iterations Number &lt;optional&gt; -1 number of iterations. If &gt; -1 it will override the original number of iterations ignoreIterations Boolean &lt;optional&gt; true will loop indefinitely if true (default), otherwise number of iterations is considered. forceRequestAnimationFrame Boolean &lt;optional&gt; false override timing and force use of requestAnimationFrame() for all frames. mode String &lt;optional&gt; &quot;forward&quot; playback mode: forward, backward, ping-pong. NOTE: These modes are not part of the Animation PNG standard. Members commit :boolean This property can be set to false when for example the canvas is not visible. The animation will still loop in the background but nothing is actually drawn to the canvas itself. Note: This also blocks calls to onframe callbacks. Type: boolean context :CanvasRenderingContext2D The 2D context used for the canvas internally. Type: CanvasRenderingContext2D currentFrame :Number Gets the current frame number. Notes setting a frame: Renders the sequence based on region, dispose and blending for each frame until requested frame is reached. This will produce a correct looking complete frame. If you only want the raw frame use the APNGParser object directly with the property frame[frameIndex] instead. The complete frame is rendered to the canvas. Type: Number currentTime :Number Sets or gets the current time in milliseconds. If playing the time is accurate, if paused or stopped the current time represents the closest frame. Setting time will set the frame which the time falls within. Type: Number duration :Number Get the duration of the entire animation in milliseconds. The duration considers playback mode. Type: Number onend :function|Null Optional callback for when an animation ended (based on number of iteration). Will not be called if stop() is invoked. Type: function | Null onframe :function|Null Optional callback that is called for each rendered frame. This callback is called after the frame has been rendered so that you can overlay graphics between each frame. Note: if you use this to draw on the animation, remember to reset your context changes (transformations, composition, clipping etc.). Type: function | Null oniteration :function|Null Optional callback for when a new iteration is started. Type: function | Null onpause :function|Null Optional callback for when an animation starts is paused. Type: function | Null onplay :function|Null Optional callback for when an animation starts to play. Type: function | Null onstop :function|Null Optional callback for when an animation is stopped. Type: function | Null Methods &lt;static&gt; toSpritesheet(apng [, options]) Produces a horizontal sprite-sheet from a APNG.Parser object. Each cell is the same size as the entire frame. This can be used as an efficient replacement for the APNGHelper as each frame is complete. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description apng APNG.Parser APNG.Parser object. options * &lt;optional&gt; a callback that is called for each cell so you can overlay graphics. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description drawCallback function &lt;optional&gt; a callback that is called for each cell so you can overlay graphics. maxWidth Number &lt;optional&gt; 8000 max width of canvas - note that some browser limits the size of the canvas element. if not wide enough the height is adjusted to generate rows instead. Returns: Type HTMLCanvasElement pause() Pause animation at current frame. play() Start playing animation from current frame. If iterations is considered it will automatically stop after last iteration (loop) has been played. stop() Stop animation and go to frame 0. Events event Event object.
